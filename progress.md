Original prompt: Implement the InfernoDrift4 revamp plan on top of the current InfernoDrift-derived game: better radar, cleaner HUD/menu, stronger graphics/effects, distinct modes/minigames, live Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects online, favicon from uploaded asset, tests, push, deploy, and verification.

2026-05-13:

- Started from `main` at `bc965cf`; current worktree was clean.
- Baseline `npm run typecheck` and `node --check script.js` passed.
- Baseline `npm test` exposed a backend WebSocket test hang/failure; this needs fixing during the online/server pass.
- User uploaded favicon source at `/Users/amandaalden/Downloads/ChatGPT Image May 13, 2026, 08_51_32 PM.png`; `sips` reports no alpha, so icon generation must key out the baked checkerboard or wrap/crop carefully.
- Added cleaner split HUD, non-interactive boost/shield status strip, forward-relative radar with player/bot/ball/objective projections in `render_game_to_text()`, mode objective state, and distinct objective markers/minigame rules.
- Added real online client UI/actions for configured WebSocket backends plus Cloudflare Worker/Durable Object scaffold, Worker workflow, stricter protocol validation, local Node backend hardening, and exact origin-spoofing test.
- Generated favicon/app icons from the uploaded wheel/flame image via `npm run icons`; outputs are `favicon.ico`, `icon.svg`, `icon-64.png`, `icon-192.png`, and `icon-512.png`.
- Fixed browser smoke regression where the status strip intercepted the HUD Menu button; `npm run smoke` now asserts Max, radar, online fallback, forced replay/demo, campaign return, and all ID4 mode routing.
- Added mobile landscape smoke coverage and a test API hook for device-mode forcing; `npm run test:e2e` now covers dev mode and phone landscape HUD/radar/touch selection.
- Ran the required `develop-web-game` Playwright client against local `http://127.0.0.1:4173/index.html`; first attempt timed out on `page.goto`, second attempt passed and produced `output/web-game/shot-0.png`, `shot-1.png`, and state JSON with clean console output.
- Added `smoke_online_local.mjs` and `npm run smoke:online-local`; it caught and fixed Online UI socket sequencing by adding a pending outbound message queue, then passed against the local Node backend with real connect/create-room/chat through the Online tab.
- Final local validations before commit: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`, `npm run build`, `npm run format`, `npm run smoke`, `npm run test:e2e`, `npm run smoke:online-local`, `npm run worker:check`, and `npm run worker:types` passed. Headless WebGL emitted GPU stall warnings only.
